#### Web stack debugging
* It is process of identifying and resolving issues in a web application's technology stack. A web application's technology stack typically consists of several layers of software that work together to deliver the application to end-users.

* The layers of a typical web stack include the following:

* The client-side layer: This layer consists of the user interface (UI) components of the application, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* The server-side layer: This layer includes the application logic that processes the user's requests and returns responses. It can include various server-side programming languages and frameworks, such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, or Node.js.

* The database layer: This layer stores the data that the application uses and retrieves. It can include various database management systems, such as MySQL or MongoDB.

* When an issue arises in a web application, debugging the stack involves identifying the layer(s) where the problem is occurring and then troubleshooting and resolving the issue.

* Debugging can involve different techniques depending on the specific issue, but some common approaches include:

* Reviewing log files: Log files can provide information about errors or warnings that occur in the application. They can help pinpoint the specific layer where the issue is happening.

* Using debugging tools: There are various debugging tools available for web developers, such as browser developer tools, server-side debugging tools, and database debugging tools.

* Testing and reproducing the issue: Reproducing the issue can help identify the cause and help test potential solutions.
