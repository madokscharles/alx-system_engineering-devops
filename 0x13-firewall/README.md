#### What is a firewall
* A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of predefined security rules. Its primary function is to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network while allowing authorized communication.

* Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software form, and they can be configured to block or allow traffic based on a range of criteria such as IP address, port number, protocol type, and more. They can also be set up to log traffic and generate alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
